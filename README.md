# VLSI Standard Cell Library

This repository contains the design files and verification results for a standard cell library developed as part of a university VLSI course. The project involved the design of fundamental CMOS logic gates and subsequent cells using Cadence and Synopsys CAD tools. It covers all stages of the design flow including schematic entry, physical layout, and post-layout simulation. The project was designed to **mimic a 65nm CMOS process** and provided a realistic understanding of modern submicron design challenges. The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with digital circuit design at the transistor level and to understand the intricacies of the VLSI design process.

## Tools Used
* Cadence Virtuoso  â€“ Schematic capture and layout design
* Calibre - DRC and LVS
